# ECG-Filtering-AdaptiveFilters
For this project, raw ECG signal data will be taken and subjected to an adaptive filter which is aimed to attenuate the P wave, QRS complex, T wave, and U wave of the ECG signal. The specifications will be chosen to best minimize the mean square error and maximize the peak signal to noise ratio between the raw ECG data and a reference input that is correlated with the noise in the primary input. Three adaptive filters were applied: least means square, normalized least means squares, and recursive least squares to compare their abilities to most effectively filter the signal.
